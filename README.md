# Reaction Game

Welcome to the Reaction Game! This engaging project is designed to test and improve your reaction time through a fast-paced, interactive experience. The game features two buttons that, when pressed, award points to the user based on their timing. It includes multiple rounds to keep the challenge going and measure your progress.

## Features

- **Two-player button interaction:** Press either button to score points.
- **Multiple rounds:** Play through several rounds to beat your high score.
- **3D-designed base:** A stylish and sturdy base to house the electronics and buttons.
- **Real hardware integration:** Utilizes Arduino Uno, 2A2 batteries, and a breadboard for seamless hardware control.

## Hardware Components

- Arduino Uno
- 2 x A2A Batteries
- Breadboard
- Two push buttons
- Connecting wires
- 3D-printed or custom-designed base

## How it Works

The game runs on an Arduino Uno that monitors button presses via the breadboard connections. When a button is pressed, the Arduino awards points based on the reaction time and updates the score. The game progresses through multiple rounds, with visual or audio cues indicating when to press the buttons.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Assemble the hardware:**
   - Connect the push buttons to the breadboard and wire them to the Arduino digital input pins.
   - Power the Arduino using the 2A2 batteries.
   - Secure everything on the 3D-designed base for stability and aesthetics.

2. **Upload the code:**
   - Clone or download this repository.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and upload the provided code to your Arduino Uno.

3. **Start playing:**
   - Follow the on-screen or serial monitor prompts to begin the game.
   - Press the buttons as quickly as possible when prompted to score points.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the code to adjust the number of rounds, scoring system, or add visual/audio effects for an enhanced experience.
